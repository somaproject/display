The frame control is our direct interface to the LCD; it runs at 50
Mhz and all of its outputs to the display are registered IOBs.

At the assertion of FSTART, the frame control sets the value on the X
and Y registers. 8 ticks later, the value on {R,G,B}in will be
sampled. That value along with the necessary control signals will be
output on the frame control interface. Note that the value on
{R,G,B}in is latched, so it may change when the next pixel is
requested.

Note that the display wants DCLK to be continuous and samples on
the falling edge of the clock.

at ~ 8 ticks per pixel, including the hsync and vsync, we should be
able to get ~20 FPS.


\section{Implementation}

To deal with the optrex front-porch and back-porch timing requirements
we fracture our FSMs into two different FSMs, a horizontal one
(hcs/hns) and a vertical one (vcs/vns).

We also abuse the row and column counters in an attempt to reduce the
number of counters. We take in the following config registers: 

HFP[9:0]
HBP[9:0]

VFP[8:0]
VBP[8:0]
